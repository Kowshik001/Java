Java provides a rich set of built-in functions through its standard libraries (Java API). Here are some key categories of Java built-in functions and brief notes about each category:

1. **String Manipulation Functions:**
   - Java's `String` class offers methods for string manipulation, such as `substring`, `length`, `charAt`, `concat`, `indexOf`, and `replace`.

2. **File and I/O Functions:**
   - The `java.io` and `java.nio` packages provide classes and methods for file input and output operations, including reading/writing files, creating directories, and more.

3. **Collections Framework:**
   - Java includes a comprehensive Collections Framework with classes like `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`, `HashSet`, `HashMap`, and more, offering methods for storing and manipulating collections of objects.

4. **Mathematical Functions:**
   - The `java.lang.Math` class contains various mathematical functions, such as `abs`, `sqrt`, `sin`, `cos`, `max`, `min`, and `random`.

5. **Date and Time Functions:**
   - Java 8 introduced the `java.time` package for handling date and time. It includes classes like `LocalDate`, `LocalTime`, and `DateTimeFormatter` for parsing, formatting, and manipulating date and time.

6. **Regular Expressions:**
   - Java's `java.util.regex` package provides classes like `Pattern` and `Matcher` for working with regular expressions, allowing you to search, match, and manipulate text patterns.

7. **Concurrency and Multithreading:**
   - Java offers a rich set of classes and interfaces in the `java.util.concurrent` package for building multithreaded applications, including classes like `ExecutorService`, `Semaphore`, and `CountDownLatch`.

8. **Input and Output Streams:**
   - The `java.io` package includes classes like `InputStream` and `OutputStream` for reading and writing binary data, while `java.io.Reader` and `java.io.Writer` are used for character-based input and output.

9. **Networking:**
   - Java provides classes like `Socket`, `ServerSocket`, and `URLConnection` for network communication, allowing you to create both client and server applications.

10. **Reflection:**
    - The reflection API allows you to inspect and manipulate classes, methods, and fields dynamically at runtime. Classes like `Class`, `Method`, and `Field` are part of this functionality.

11. **Exception Handling:**
    - Java's exception handling mechanism provides built-in functions for handling exceptions, including `try`, `catch`, `throw`, and `finally`.

12. **System and Environment:**
    - The `System` class provides access to system-related functions, including `System.out` for standard output, `System.in` for standard input, and `System.currentTimeMillis()` for getting the current time in milliseconds.

13. **Internationalization and Localization:**
    - Java supports internationalization and localization through classes like `java.util.Locale` and methods for formatting dates, numbers, and currency in different locales.
